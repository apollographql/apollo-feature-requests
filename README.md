# 👋 Welcome

Many of the features in Apollo Client came from suggestions by you, the community! While the project has its own repo for tracking issues, we welcome ideas about how to make the client better for your use cases. Unless there is overwhelming demand for a feature, it might not get implemented immediately, but please include as much information as possible that will help people have a discussion about your proposal.

## 🧑‍🚀 Apollo feature request process

This repository is used to track [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) feature requests.

Just Click 👉 [here](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-feature-requests/issues/new) to open a new feature request!

## ✅ Feature request checklist

Before making a feature request here please consider the following:

1. Does this feature request support a wide range of use cases or is it uniquely specific to your individual use case?

> If it's unique to you, this may not be an ideal feature for the entire client. Feel free to ask for help or advice in our [Community Forum](https://community.apollographql.com/).

2. Is this just a question or discussion on how to do something in the Apollo Platform?

> If so, this might make a better post in our [Community Forum](https://community.apollographql.com/).

3. Is there a work around available to you?

> Is this a more convenient way to do something that is already possible, or is there some blocker that makes a workaround unfeasible?

## 🌎 Community involvement

The [issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-feature-requests/issues/) area of this repository should be used to discuss new features and possible implementation designs. You can show your support for (or against!) features by using GitHub reactions, or by adding meaningful details which help the feature definition become more clear. Please do not comment with "+1" as it creates a lot of noise (e-mails, notifications, etc.).

## Core platform feature requests

This repository used to track feature requests across the entire supergraph core platform. If you're coming here to request a feature outside of Apollo Client, please open an issue in the respective repository instead.
